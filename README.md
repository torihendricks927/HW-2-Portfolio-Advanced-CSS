## Portfolio Description

This portfolio has been designed as a first draft resume for applying to future technology companies. The portfolio contains my contact information, summary of myself, and examples of projects I have completed to show my abilities in HTML and CSS. I have provided a navigation bar for easier access to each section of my portfolio.
